                2.1. Our Secure Wallet allows Users to remit crypto assets to
                Secure Wallet Account from external third-party service and vice
                versa except to certain limitations, which may be updated from
                time to time. You indemnify and hold Secure Wallet services
                limited harmless against any claims, demands and damages,
                whether direct, indirect, consequential or special, or any other
                damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, loss of use,
                loss of profits or loss of data, whether in an action in
                contract, tort (including but not limited to negligence) or
                otherwise, originated from or in any way connected with your
                deposit/withdrawal transactions requests in violation of settled
                limitations. For the purposes thereof the “Third-party service”
                shall mean any platform or network in which crypto assets belong
                to you or where you are the beneficial owner of crypto assets;
                and this platform is maintained by a third party outside of the
                Services; including, but not limited to third-party accounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                2.2. Secure Wallet ETH addresses are ERC20 compliant, however,
                not all ERC20 tokens are supported in the app. Transactions of
                currently unlisted tokens to Secure Wallet addresses may appear
                on the blockchain, however, they will not be available on your
                balance in the Service until they are added to our list.
              </li>
              <li>
                2.3. Secure Wallet represents that it never intended or desired
                to use tokens and/or coins that can be classified as "security"
                by SEC and/or other competent national authorities and endeavors
                all possible measures to be sure that crypto assets that you can
                use in our Wallet cannot be classified as "security". For the
                avoidance of any doubt the provisions of this clause shall not
                constitute or deemed to be construed to constitute any warranty
                and/or investment, financial, legal or any other professional
                advice, that any crypto asset on our Secure Wallet is not a
                security. The responsibility for the fact that the instrument
                cannot be treated as “security” lies with the issuer of token
                and/or coin. If there is any risk or speculations that token
                and/or coin can be treated as “security”, the Wallet reserves
                the right to prohibit such tokens and/or coins in our Wallet and
                discontinue any transactions with those at its sole discretion.

                3.1. In order to protect your crypto assets from unauthorized
                access, use, or spending we use a variety of physical and
                technical measures designed to protect our systems and your
                crypto assets, which include, but are not limited to a
                diversification of crypto assets in different allocations
                whether on a segregate record (account, wallet) or not. By
                remitting your crypto assets to Secure Wallet Account you
                entrust and entitle Us to ultimately take decisions on the
                safety and security of your crypto assets.

                be willing to communicate to you in connection with your Secure

                communication, agreement, document, receipt, notice and
                disclosure, which may be from time to time addressed to User by
                Secure Wallet. You may withdraw your consent to receive
                electronic Communications by sending a withdrawal notice to
                support. If this is a case you waive your right to plead
                ignorance. If you decline or withdraw consent to receive
                electronic Communications, Secure Wallet may suspend or

                3.3. When you request Us to Deposit/Withdraw crypto assets into

                Withdrawals completed via Secure Wallet ("Fees") as defined by
                Us, which We may change from time to time. Changes to the Fees
                are effective as of the effective date, and will apply
                prospectively to any Exchanges and Withdrawals that take place
                following the effective date of such revised Fees.
              </li>
              <li>
                4.2. Payment of Fees. You authorize Us, or our designated

                with Exchanges and Withdrawals you complete via the Secure

                or in any other form at our discretion and without prior notice

              <li>
                5.1. In order to use our Services, the User is obliged to create
                an account with Secure Wallet to use our Services with its full
                functionality. “Secure Wallet Account” is a User account
                accessible after the registration process and via the Services,
                where crypto assets may be stored and operated by Secure Wallet
                on behalf of a User. The process of creation of the Secure
                Wallet Account requires a valid e-mail and special verification
                procedure. E-mail provided within the registration and verified
                e-mail are used to identify the user and can be used for
                communicational purposes, PIN restore, Services updates etc.
                Please, note that a verified e-mail does not become a login
                e-mail.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.2. When creating a Secure Wallet account, the wallet generates
                and stores a private and public cryptographic key pair that you
                can use to make transactions with crypto assets. The public key
                can be shared to complete transactions. The private key uniquely
                matches the wallet address and is only used by the wallet to
                authorize transactions to and from your Secure Wallet. As Secure
                Wallet is a hosted wallet, it’s not feasible to provide the
                private keys to individual wallet addresses.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.3. The User is obliged to create a strong password that is not
                used for any other websites, online or off-line services and
                maintain the security of his Secure Wallet Account by protecting
                the password and restricting access to the Secure Wallet
                Account.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.4. In case Secure Wallet detects suspicious activity on Secure
                Wallet account, Secure Wallet conducts AML/KYC procedure for the
                user. To be sure that nobody has unauthorized access to the
                users account, We ask to provide all necessary information for
                verification, including without limitation an ID, photo,
                screenshots showing the source of all your incoming transactions
                etc. The User is obliged to pass through AML/KYC procedures,
                which may be applied to the User from time to time, and provide
                accurate and truthful information about himself as well as
                maintain and promptly update his Secure Wallet Account
                information in case of any changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.5. The User is obliged to provide the information and
                credentials as may be required by Secure Wallet from time to
                time in order to verify the ownership and/or source of funds of
                crypto assets of the third-party service that are remitted to
                the User’s Secure Wallet Account.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.6. We reserve the right to limit the scope of our Services to
                users, who have not verified their identity and/or set up a
                necessary level of security of account and/or failed to prove
                the ownership and/or source of funds. Limitation of our Services
                may depend on the established security level of the account, for
                instance and the following criteria may be considered:
                verification of e-mail, social network authorization etc.
                Please, note that restrictions, mentioned herein are for
                illustrative purpose only. We reserve the right to limit the
                scope of our Services at our sole discretion and without prior
                notification to you.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.7. The balance of crypto assets displayed by the Secure Wallet
                in the user interface of your application is accurate and the
                balance represents the current amount of crypto assets you are
                able to transfer or exchange. Different digital distribution
                platforms, such as Google Play and App Store, can disable the
                support for certain cryptocurrencies without giving a prior
                notice to Secure Wallet. It may lead to removing the displayed
                balance of the disabled cryptocurrency from Secure Wallet
                applications available on such platforms. Your balance in the
                Service, however, is not affected, and can be accessed in Secure
                Wallet applications via an alternative digital distribution
                platform or on the web.

                We may deem necessary, including without limitation the Force
                Majeure Event; maintenance work; inability of the third service
                provider to provide you services; your request of account

                investigation, or government proceeding related to You or your
                Secure Wallet Account; and/or in case we perceive a heightened
                risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your
                account activity We may, in our sole discretion and without
                liability to you, with or without prior notice:
